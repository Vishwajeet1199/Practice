            Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which
            originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. While these sports
            vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel and, notably, playing surface, they share broad
            characteristics of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or disk into a goal.
